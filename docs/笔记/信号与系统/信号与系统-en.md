## 1.1continuous-time and discrete-time signals

For continuous-time signal, The total energy over the time interval $t_1\leq t\leq t_2$ in a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is defined as 
$$
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}|x(t)|^2dt
$$
Similarly, the total energy in a discrete-time signal $x[n]$ over the time interval $t_1 \leq t \leq t_2$ is defined as
$$
\sum_{n=n_1}^{n_2}|x[n]|^2
$$
